the problem is when you want to switch to another machine for any reason you want your config to be set up as soon as possible how to do that is there any tool that will help me do that ?

ANSWER: yes there is GNU Stow
GNU: stands for GNu's not Unix
GNU utils: is the essential system tools like compilers (GCC), libs (GLIBC), shell utitlies, text editors (Emacs)

GNU Stow: is symlink manager that simplifies the prcess of managing dotfiles & sotftware configurations, it helps your organize files and directories by creating sym links from a central directory yo your home directory (or another target directory)

# INFO:
symlink help as access file or directory from another location without the need of mouving or duplication that file or directory

# Conclustion: nadya had l9adiya atkhalini hat l config dyali kamla fi file dir wahed or git repo wahed, all i need to do is to colone this rep & stow configes that i want to use
